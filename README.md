# Start from FreeCodeCamp
I began to learn Front-End programming in March and come to realize that the only way to learn well is to do projects.i.e.(Learning by doing.)
Reading books/documents or watching tutorial videos is far from enough.

- Project One:[Build a Tribute Page](https://www.freecodecamp.cn/challenges/build-a-tribute-page)
- Project Two:[Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.cn/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)
